                This is a 4 in a row game that I made overnight in 5hrs and has
                never been updated since. It serves as a reminder to me as to
                what I can achieve.

                Had to make a game a chess game with custom rules used in
                r/anarchychess subreddit due to which I couldnt use libraries
                like chess js or chessboard js therefore all the chess rules are
                coded from scratch like chess
